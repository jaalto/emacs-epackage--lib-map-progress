Description: library of mapping macros that report progress
 This library defines mapping macros that report progress.
 .
 For many of the standard and CL mapping functions like `mapc' macros
 like `mapc-with-progress-reporter' are defined here.  The arguments
 have the same meaning as the respective arguments of the mapping
 function or of `make-progress-reporter', which ever has an argument by
 the same name.
 .
 Even when the original mapping function supports multiple sequences the
 macros defined here only support one.  All of `make-progress-reporter's
 arguments except for MESSAGE are optional.  This includes the starting
 and final state arguments.
 .
 All standard mapping function with exactly two mandatory arguments are
 supported by `map-with-progress-reporter', which can be used when no
 progress reporting variant of that function has been defined here.  But
 any optional arguments the original might have are not supported.
